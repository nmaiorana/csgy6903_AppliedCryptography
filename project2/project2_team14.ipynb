        "# Exploring the Security of One-Time and Many-Time Pads\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This team project investigates the cryptographic security of the one-time pad, known for its perfect security under certain conditions, and explores the implications of reusing a key, referred to as a many-time pad. We will examine the practical aspects of implementing these encryption methods, analyze their vulnerabilities, and develop strategies to exploit these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. Here is some background story in signal intelligence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "1. Understand One-Time Pad\n",
        "Examine the concept of the one-time pad, its implementation, and why it is considered perfectly secure.\n",
        "2. Implement One-Time Pad Encryption and Decryption\n",
        "Develop a Python program that simulates the encryption and decryption process between two parties.\n",
        "3. Explore Many-Time Pad\n",
        "Extend the one-time pad implementation to simulate a many-time pad scenario, where a single key is used to encrypt multiple messages.\n",
        "4. Cryptanalysis of Many-Time Pad\n",
        "Design and execute an attack strategy to decrypt messages encrypted with a many-time pad, focusing on exploiting the vulnerabilities introduced by key reuse."

        "The one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that provides perfect secrecy when certain requirements are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a summary of its theoretical basis, requirements, and operational\n",
        "principles based on the search results:\n",
        "\n",
        "The OTP is an encryption method that involves pairing a plaintext with a random secret key (one-time pad), where each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key concepts and principles behind the one-time pad include:\n",
        "Perfect Secrecy:\n",
        "\n",
        "When utilized appropriately, the one-time pad achieves perfect secrecy, or Shannon secrecy. Perfect secrecy implies that even with unlimited computational capabilities, an attacker cannot learn anything about the plaintext without knowing the key. Claude Shannon demonstrated this characteristic in his seminal paper \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\" in 1949.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Length: The key in a one-time pad must be at least the same length as the plaintext message. This ensures that each bit of plaintext is encrypted with a distinct, independent bit of the key. The key length criterion is critical for ensuring complete secrecy. If the key is shorter than the plaintext, or if it is reused, the one-time pad's security is jeopardized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Distribution: Since the security of the one-time pad is fully dependent on the secrecy of the key, securely disseminating the key to both the sender and the recipient is critical. Any compromise in key distribution may jeopardize the confidentiality of communication. Secure key distribution mechanisms, such as physically handing the key in person or using secure communication channels, are required to ensure the one-time pad's security.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Generation: The key to a one-time pad should be produced using a completely random technique. This ensures that the key is random and cannot be predicted or guessed by an attacker.\n",
        " Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are unsuitable for producing one-time\n",
        "pad keys because they are deterministic and susceptible to attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Usage: As the name implies, the key in a one-time pad should only be used once. Reusing the key, even partially, jeopardizes the security of the encryption scheme. If the same key is used to encrypt several messages, an attacker can utilize statistical analysis and patterns in the ciphertext to obtain information about the plaintext.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modular Arithmetic: The operational principles of the one-time pad include modular arithmetic. In encryption, each character of the plaintext is merged with the matching character of the key using modular addition. Decryption entails reversing this procedure using modular subtraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modular arithmetic ensures that the ciphertext stays inside a specific range, usually modulo the\n",
        "size of the alphabet or character set being employed.\n",
        "Requirements:\n",
        "1. The key must be at least as long as the plaintext.\n",
        "2. The key must be random, entirely sampled from a non-algorithmic source like a hardware\n",
        "random number generator.\n",
        "3. The key must never be reused in whole or in part.\n",
        "4. The key must be kept completely secret by the communicating parties\n",
        "\n",
        "Operational Principles:\n",
        "· The OTP encryption involves combining each bit of the plaintext with the\n",
        "corresponding bit from the one-time pad using XOR operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "· The resulting ciphertext is impossible to decrypt or break if the four conditionsmentioned above are met\n",
        "\n",
        "Security: The OTP provides perfect secrecy, meaning that even with infinite computational power, an attacker cannot retrieve the plaintext if the requirements are fulfilled\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges: While theoretically secure, OTP has practical challenges such as secure key distribution, making it impractical for most applications due to the difficulty in meeting its stringent requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the one-time pad stands out as a theoretically unbreakable cipher when implemented correctly, offering unparalleled security through its unique operational principles and strict key management requirements"

        "As we known the One-Time Pad (OTP) is a theoretically unbreakable encryption scheme if the key is truly random and used only once. However, when the same key is reused across multiple messages, it introduces a vulnerability known as the Many-Time Pad Attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, Eva (the attacker) has collected 10 ciphertexts that were encrypted with the same key. She also knows that the plaintexts are in English and only contain letters, numbers, spaces, commas, periods, and question marks. Her goal is to recover the key and use it to decrypt the target message (the 11th ciphertext).\n",
