    "# Exploring the Security of One-Time and Many-Time Pads\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This team project investigates the cryptographic security of the one-time pad, known for its perfect security under certain conditions, and explores the implications of reusing a key, referred to as a many-time pad. We will examine the practical aspects of implementing these encryption methods, analyze their vulnerabilities, and develop strategies to exploit these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. Here is some background story in signal intelligence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. Understand One-Time Pad\n",
    "Examine the concept of the one-time pad, its implementation, and why it is considered perfectly secure.\n",
    "2. Implement One-Time Pad Encryption and Decryption\n",
    "Develop a Python program that simulates the encryption and decryption process between two parties.\n",
    "3. Explore Many-Time Pad\n",
    "Extend the one-time pad implementation to simulate a many-time pad scenario, where a single key is used to encrypt multiple messages.\n",
    "4. Cryptanalysis of Many-Time Pad\n",
    "Design and execute an attack strategy to decrypt messages encrypted with a many-time pad, focusing on exploiting the vulnerabilities introduced by key reuse."
