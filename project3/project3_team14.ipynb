The first 16 to the first mini block cipher, the remaining 16 to the second mini block cipher. The meet in the middle attack is to match the state for the first encryption of mini block cipher and the second decryption mini block. How many operations are needed to such attack?\n",

        "D. What is the trade off in this MITM attack?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The trade off in this attack lies in the fact that the meet in the-middle attack reduces the time complexity from O(2^32) to O(2^16). In the meet in the middle attack, you need to store the intermediate results of the first encryption phase which requires additional memory compared to the exhaustive key search. However, this increase in memory usage might be manageable compared to the significant reduction in time complexity. Therefore, the trade off is between memory usage and time complexity."
